🐍 Python Fundamentals Roadmap 🚀

A personal project-based roadmap to mastering core Python concepts — one mini-project at a time.
1. Hello World

👋 Project: First Python Program
Problem: Write a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
2. Lists & Tuples

📦 Project: Grocery Basket Tracker
Problem: Create a program where the user enters items (name and price) for a grocery list. Use a list of tuples to store each item like ("Apple", 35). Print the full list and total cost at the end.
3. Sets

🧼 Project: Duplicate Cleaner
Problem: Ask the user to enter a list of names (some might be duplicates). Use a set to remove duplicates and print the cleaned list. Also, show how many duplicates were removed.
4. Dictionary

📚 Project: Student Gradebook
Problem: Build a dictionary where student names are keys, and their grades are values. Allow the user to add students and grades, update them, and print the full class list with grades.
5. Conditional Statements

⏰ Project: Sleep Advisor
Problem: Ask the user how many hours they sleep each night. Based on the input, give personalized feedback:

    8 or more: "You're well rested!"

    5–7: "Try to get more rest."

    Less than 5: "Sleep deprivation alert!"

6. While Loop

🎲 Project: Dice Rolling Simulator
Problem: Simulate a dice roll. After each roll, ask the user if they want to roll again (yes/no). Keep looping until the user says no. Use the random module to roll between 1–6.
7. For Loop

🔢 Project: Multiplication Table Generator
Problem: Ask the user for a number. Use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number (e.g., 5 × 1 to 5 × 10).
8. Nested For Loop

🎮 Project: Simple Pixel Art Grid
Problem: Ask the user for a grid size (e.g., 5×5). Then use a nested for loop to print a grid of “⬜” and let the user choose a row and column to change to “🟩”.
9. Functions

🧮 Project: Mini Calculator
Problem: Build a calculator with functions like add(a, b), subtract(a, b), multiply(a, b), and divide(a, b). Let the user choose the operation and enter numbers.
10. Arguments

✍️ Project: Blog Title Formatter
Problem: Write a function called format_title(title, style) that accepts a string and a formatting style:

    "upper" → uppercase

    "lower" → lowercase

    "title" → title case
    Then print the result based on user input.

11. Lambda

📊 Project: Student Sorter
Problem: Create a list of students as tuples (name, grade), e.g., [("Yop", 95), ("Ana", 80)]. Use a lambda function to sort the list by grade in descending order.
12. List Comprehensions

🧠 Project: Even Number Extractor
Problem: Ask the user for a list of numbers. Use a list comprehension to extract all even numbers and display them.
13. String Manipulation

✂️ Project: Text Cleaner
Problem: Ask the user for a paragraph. Remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and count the number of words.
14. Error Handling (try/except)

🛡️ Project: Safe Calculator
Problem: Modify your mini calculator to handle errors like division by zero or invalid input using try/except blocks.
15. File Handling

📁 Project: Notes App
Problem: Let users write, read, and delete notes stored in a text file using Python’s file I/O.
16. Modules and Imports

📦 Project: Weather Reporter
Problem: Use the datetime and random modules to create a fake weather forecast generator for the week.
17. Classes & Objects (OOP)

🏠 Project: House Builder Simulator
Problem: Create a House class with attributes like address, price, and square_feet. Instantiate a few and print a summary.
18. Inheritance

🧬 Project: RPG Characters
Problem: Create a base Character class. Then create subclasses like Wizard, Warrior, or Rogue with custom abilities and stats.
19. Working with JSON

🔐 Project: Password Vault
Problem: Let users save passwords to websites and store them in a JSON file. Users can retrieve passwords by website name.
20. Date and Time

🕒 Project: Countdown Timer
Problem: Ask the user for a number of seconds and then count down to zero using the time module. Print a message when time’s up.
21. List Slicing

🔍 Project: Recent Messages Viewer
Problem: Simulate a chat app with a list of messages. Let users view the last 5 messages using slicing.
