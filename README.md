# Python Fundamentals Roadmap 🚀

A personal project-based roadmap to mastering core Python concepts — one mini-project at a time.

1. Lists & Tuples
📦 Project: Grocery Basket Tracker
 Problem: Create a program where the user enters items (name and price) for a grocery list. Use a list of tuples to store each item like ("Apple", 35). Print the full list and total cost at the end.

2. Sets
🧼 Project: Duplicate Cleaner
 Problem: Ask the user to enter a list of names (some might be duplicates). Use a set to remove duplicates and print the cleaned list. Also, show how many duplicates were removed.

3. Dictionary
📚 Project: Student Gradebook
 Problem: Build a dictionary where student names are keys, and their grades are values. Allow the user to add students and grades, update them, and print the full class list with grades.

4. Conditional Statements
⏰ Project: Sleep Advisor
 Problem: Ask the user how many hours they sleep each night. Based on the input, give personalized feedback:
8 or more: "You're well rested!"
5–7: "Try to get more rest."
Less than 5: "Sleep deprivation alert!"

5. While Loop
🎲 Project: Dice Rolling Simulator
 Problem: Simulate a dice roll. After each roll, ask the user if they want to roll again (yes/no). Keep looping until the user says no. Use the random module to roll between 1–6.

6. For Loop
🔢 Project: Multiplication Table Generator
 Problem: Ask the user for a number. Use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number (e.g., 5 × 1 to 5 × 10).

7. Nested For Loop
🎮 Project: Simple Pixel Art Grid
 Problem: Ask the user for a grid size (e.g., 5×5). Then use a nested for loop to print a grid of “⬜” and let the user choose a row and column to change to “🟩”.

8. Functions
🧮 Project: Mini Calculator
 Problem: Build a calculator with functions like add(a, b), subtract(a, b), multiply(a, b), and divide(a, b). Let the user choose the operation and enter numbers.

9. Arguments
✍️ Project: Blog Title Formatter
 Problem: Write a function called format_title(title, style) that accepts a string and a formatting style:
"upper" → uppercase title
"lower" → lowercase title
"title" → title case
 Then print the result based on user input.

10. Lambda
📊 Project: Student Sorter
 Problem: Create a list of students as tuples (name, grade), e.g., [("Yop", 95), ("Ana", 80)]. Use a lambda function to sort the list by grade in descending order.

11. List Comprehensions
🧠 Project: Even Number Extractor
 Problem: Ask the user for a list of numbers. Use a list comprehension to extract all even numbers and display them.

12. String Manipulation
✂️ Project: Text Cleaner
 Problem: Ask the user for a paragraph. Remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and count the number of words.

13. Error Handling (try/except)
🛡️ Project: Safe Calculator
 Problem: Modify your mini calculator to handle errors like division by zero or invalid input using try/except blocks.

14. File Handling
📁 Project: Notes App
 Problem: Let users write, read, and delete notes stored in a text file using Python’s file I/O.

15. Modules and Imports
📦 Project: Weather Reporter
 Problem: Use the datetime and random modules to create a fake weather forecast generator for the week.

16. Classes & Objects (OOP)
🏠 Project: House Builder Simulator
 Problem: Create a House class with attributes like address, price, and square_feet. Instantiate a few and print a summary.

17. Inheritance
🧬 Project: RPG Characters
 Problem: Create a base Character class. Then create subclasses like Wizard, Warrior, or Rogue with custom abilities and stats.

18. Working with JSON
🔐 Project: Password Vault
 Problem: Let users save passwords to websites and store them in a JSON file. Users can retrieve passwords by website name.

19. Date and Time
🕒 Project: Countdown Timer
 Problem: Ask the user for a number of seconds and then count down to zero using the time module. Print a message when time’s up.

20. List Slicing
🔍 Project: Recent Messages Viewer
 Problem: Simulate a chat app with a list of messages. Let users view the last 5 messages using slicing.
